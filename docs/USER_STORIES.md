# GTFO.CrashTestDummies — User Stories
> ✅ done (shipped & tested) · 🟡 partial · ⬜ planned. Every ✅ cites the test.

## Priority backlog
_Nothing recorded yet._

## Tickets
> Permanent log of every change and fix — this repo's ticket system. Rows are append-only: never
> delete or reword one; only move its Status (open → closed / wont-do) and fill in Ref. Status is
> a word, not a glyph, so tickets don't count toward the story index. Keep this section last.
